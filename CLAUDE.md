## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at them via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at the start of each session for the relevant project

## 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between the main branch and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, and demonstrate correctness

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask, "Is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point to logs, errors, and failing tests — then resolve them
- Require zero context switching from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management
1. Plan First: Write a plan in `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. Verify Plan: Check in before starting implementation
3. Track Progress: Mark items complete as you go
4. Explain Changes: Provide a high-level summary at each step
5. Document Results: Add a review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. Capture Lessons: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles
- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Minimize code impact
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Maintain senior developer standards
- Minimal Impact: Only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing new bugs
